      1. Introduction to $routeProvider
The magic of Routing is taken care by a service provider that Angular provides out of the box called $routeProvider. An Angular service is a singleton object created by a service factory. These service factories are functions which, in turn, are created by a service provider. The service providers are constructor functions. When instantiated they must contain a property called $get, which holds the service factory function.

When we use AngularJSâ€™s dependency injection and inject a service object in our Controller, Angular uses $injector to find corresponding service injector. Once it get a hold on service injector, it uses $get method of it to get an instance of service object. Sometime the service provider needs certain info in order to instantiate service object.
